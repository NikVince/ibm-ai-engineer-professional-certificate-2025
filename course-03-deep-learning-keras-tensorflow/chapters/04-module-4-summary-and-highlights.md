# Course 3, Module 4: Summary and Highlights

## Overview
This module covers unsupervised learning techniques and generative models in Keras, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and diffusion models, along with their applications for discovering hidden patterns in data.

## Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Machine learning where algorithms find patterns in data without labels or predefined outcomes.
- **Categories**: Broadly categorized into clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- **Applications**: Customer segmentation, image compression, fraud detection, and anomaly detection.
- **Tools**: TensorFlow provides robust tools to facilitate unsupervised learning tasks.

## Autoencoders
- **Architecture**: Consist of two main parts - encoder and decoder.
- **Components**: Basic architecture includes encoder, bottleneck, and decoder.
- **Types**: Basic autoencoders, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and convolutional autoencoders.
